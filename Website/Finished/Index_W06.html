					<h1>Home</h1>
					<p>Welcome to my website. This was created as part of a college module in order to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.
					I picked myself as my theme because who else would I want to talk about!?? Have a look around, there isn't much to see just 
					some stuff about what I do and what I like. As you can see that is indeed me on the right in those pictures. I know, I know 
					what a handsome devil. And now some people in their attempts to get famous have requested a space on this god forsaken website.</p>
					<img src="Images/Andrew.jpg" alt = "Photo" Title = "Andy Pandy"/>
					<p class = "description">Here is my housemate Andrew Gallagher, not so much of a looker but you know the poor lad, he tries so hard.</p>
					<img src="Images/Mark.jpg" alt = "Photo" Title = "Maracoose"/>
					<p class = "description">Mark Desmond because no website is complete without him.</p>
					<img src="Images/Dave.jpg" alt = "Photo" Title = "Rank"/>
					<p class = "description">David Flynn, technically didn't request but I know he wants to be here.</p>
					<img src="Images/Eoghan.jpg" alt = "Photo" Title = "Owen"/>
					<p class = "description">Yohan Dennehy, all the way from Norway this lad. Once again he didn't need to tell me he wanted to be here.</p>
					<p>Well that's that, hope you have a nice time on the rest of the site, I recommend the music page mostly but I'm sure that 
					wont be to everybody's taste.</p>
					<p>Signing Off,<br>
					Sir Tobias A. Burns of The Dirty Oak Grove.</p>
